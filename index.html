          <p>
            I am a year 11 at Te Kura Correspondence School. I enjoy reading,
            playing chess, and making art. My favourite sport is volleyball. I
            am also very passionate about Women and Youth empowerment. I believe
            in giving youth opportunities to develop their skills, confidence
            and support they need to set a path for themselves. My best subject
            in school is Digital Technology. This is because I do lots of extra
            activities outside of school to do with programming and digital
            technologies. I also love to teach and run workshops for youth.
